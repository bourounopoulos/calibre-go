2. If you are facing sign-in issues with OneDrive or you can't get past Progress bar while trying to add a library, please terminate the app by opening Recent Applications screen on your device and try again.
3. In case your calibre library folder on OneDrive is not detected please retry. In case of an exception reported on the screen, please send us an email.

## Which cloud services are supported?

*   Google Drive
*   [Microsoft OneDrive](#onedrive-integration)
*   Dropbox

## Can I read my downloaded books with Calibre-go?

No. Calibre-go is **not a reader** app. There are already many beautifully functional reading application on Play Store that support a multitude of formats & features. Google Drive comes pre-integrated with most android phones and it has an integrated PDF reader. Same goes with Dropbox android application too. Calibre-go launches any of these apps for you when you try to open a book through Calibre-go.

## Downloading multiple books at once?

There is currently no support for downloading multiple books at once because the intent of the application is to browse your library but download books only on demand when you need them. The device storage is constrained. Keeping all your books on device defeats the purpose of cloud integration. This is what we feel; though if there are enough demands for such a feature, we might go ahead with the implementation.

## SD card support?

Not yet! That is still under development.
